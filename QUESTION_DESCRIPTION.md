# User Session Management - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive user session management system demonstrating session lifecycle management, activity tracking, session state persistence, user activity analytics, behavioral tracking, user preference management, and GDPR compliance using SQLite3 for data storage. This project teaches essential concepts for building user-centric applications with proper session handling and privacy compliance.

## Project Objectives

1. **User Session Management:** Master session creation, validation, expiration, and destruction using secure session IDs, understand session lifecycle, and implement session state management with SQLite persistence.

2. **Activity Tracking:** Learn to track user activities and events, implement event logging systems, store activity data persistently, and create comprehensive activity histories for analysis.

3. **Session State Management:** Implement session data storage for maintaining user state across requests, manage shopping carts, form data, and user context using SQLite-backed sessions.

4. **User Activity Analytics:** Build analytics systems to analyze user behavior, calculate engagement metrics, identify popular features, and generate insights from activity data.

5. **Behavioral Tracking:** Track user journeys through applications, identify common behavior patterns, analyze feature usage, and understand user workflows.

6. **User Preferences:** Implement user preference management for themes, languages, notifications, and privacy settings with persistent storage and default values.

7. **Compliance Data Handling:** Implement GDPR compliance including right to access, right to be forgotten, consent management, and data retention policies.

## Key Features to Implement

  - Event logging with SQLite
  - Activity history retrieval
  - Event type categorization
  - IP and user agent tracking

- **User Analytics:**
  - Activity summaries
  - Active user counting
  - Popular page tracking
  - Session duration calculation
  - Event breakdown analysis

- **Behavioral Tracking:**
  - User journey tracking
  - Common pattern identification
  - Feature usage statistics
  - Conversion funnel analysis

- **User Preferences:**
  - Preference storage with SQLite

  - Preference updates
  - Category-based preferences
  - Privacy preference management

- **GDPR Compliance:**
  - User data export
  - User data deletion
  - Consent tracking
  - Data retention policies
  - Privacy controls

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Session Security:** Generating secure session IDs, preventing session hijacking, implementing session timeout, and managing session fixation attacks.

- **Data Privacy:** Implementing GDPR requirements, managing user consent, handling data deletion requests, and ensuring privacy compliance.

- **Performance:** Optimizing session lookups, indexing activity data, managing database growth, and implementing efficient queries.

- **State Management:** Deciding what to store in sessions, managing session size, handling concurrent requests, and ensuring data consistency.

- **Analytics Accuracy:** Collecting meaningful metrics, avoiding tracking bias, respecting user privacy, and generating actionable insights.

- **Data Retention:** Balancing data retention for analytics with privacy requirements, implementing automatic cleanup, and managing storage costs.

- **Compliance:** Understanding GDPR requirements, implementing data subject rights, managing consent, and maintaining audit trails.

## Expected Outcome

You will create a production-ready session management system with comprehensive activity tracking, analytics, and GDPR compliance. The system will demonstrate proper session handling, user privacy protection, and data management with SQLite persistence.
